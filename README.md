# AirBNBOslo
This repository aims to explore Airbnb data of Oslo city in Norway.  
Particularly, this we target to answer four business questions:  
1. How are advertised accommodations distributed across neighborhoods/districts in Oslo?
2. What are accommodation types mostly advertised in Airbnb in Oslo?
3. How do accommodation prices look like?
4. What price we can suggest to a new accommodation owner who wants to post an advertisement in Airbnb?


The repository contains ONE ipython notebook.
